I am a passionate and dedicated **Machine Learning and Software Development Enthusiast** currently pursuing my MS in Computer Science at the University of California, Davis. 
My journey in technology has been driven by a keen interest in solving complex problems and leveraging data to generate impactful insights.

### Current Research
- Developing transparent models for medicine and law to ensure fair decision-making with Dr. Patrick Romano and Dr. Monika Ray
- Creating metrics for speech intelligibility with Dr. Lee Miller, optimized for better speech synthesis.
  
Previously, I studied language polarization using LLMs like GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 in political Sources with Dr. Anshuman and Dr. Magdalena.
 
- âš¡ Fun fact: I'm deeply fascinated by the potential of applied machine learning and enjoy conducting research to explore how these technologies can solve real-world problems and improve everyday life.

Let's connect and innovate together!
