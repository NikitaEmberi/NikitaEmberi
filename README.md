### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a passionate and dedicated **Machine Learning and Software Development Enthusiast** currently pursuing my MS in Computer Science at the University of California, Davis. 
My journey in technology has been driven by a keen interest in solving complex problems and leveraging data to generate impactful insights.

### Current Research
- Working with Patrick Romano and Dr. Monika Ray on developing transparent models for applications in medicine and law to ensure reliability and fairness in decision-making processes.
- Collaborating with Dr. Lee Miller at the Center of Mind and Brain to create metrics for assessing speech intelligibility, validated by Speech-Language Pathologists. Converting these metrics into loss functions for model optimization and developing speech enhancement models to improve synthesized speech quality. Integrating these advancements into an end-to-end system for intelligible speech synthesis.

Previously, I also worked on investigating language polarization with Dr. Anshuman Chhabra and Dr. Magdalena. We dissected the polarization in unstructured natural language found in political sources. By employing LLMs, including GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, we structured the study of language polarization to enhance our understanding of language use across various contexts.

- âš¡ Fun fact: I'm deeply fascinated by the potential of applied machine learning and enjoy conducting research to explore how these technologies can solve real-world problems and improve everyday life.

Let's connect and innovate together!
